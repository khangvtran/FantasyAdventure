Linux Basic Helps for anyone who needs it:
	- To see your current directory:
	pwd

	- To go to a directory:
	cd dirA\dir2\dir3

	- To see all the file in the current directory, including hidden file:
	ls -a


Git Basic Guideline:
* Rule of Thumbs:
	- Always make sure you know what files are in your directory. Use: ls -a
	- Always make sure you are at your branch. Use: git status
	- When collaborate with other people, pull from GitHub server repo before doing any additional work . Use: git pull 
	  Your additional work must be built on top of what is currently on your branch on the remote server. Otherwise, there will be conflict.
	  If there is conflict in timeline, you would not be able to push your work. 
	- Only push to GitHub server repo code that works
	- It is advisable to use an additional storage of code in addition to GitHub (We use Google Drive.)
	


* Beginning:

	- Go into the directory (folder) where you want your work to be stored

	- To clone the github server repo into your local machine:
	git clone https://github.com/khangvtran/FantasyAdventure.git
	
	- To see status of the current branch. You will
	git status

	- To create new branch:
	git branch BrandName

	- To move into a branch:
	git checkout BrandName

* Working and pushing
	- Make sure you are at your branch (see steps above)
	
	- To get what is currently on GitHub server repo (this is important to avoid commit timeline conflict):
	git pull

	- To add a file :
	git add FileName 
	or to add everything: git add *

	- To commit:
	git commit -m"description of what you are committing"

	- To push onto GitHub server repo:
	git push

	- For the first time pushing, you are likely need to copy the command that GitHub tells you
	  Also, GitHub might ask you to enter your username and password

* To merge a branch (For integration):
	- example: to merge branch ABC to branch master
	git checkout master
	git merge ABC
